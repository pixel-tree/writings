### 140520: The expressive power of the (digital) line

Tim Ingold guest lecture. The talk was intensely inspiring throughout, but one thing really stuck in my mind: 'the expressive power of the line,' by which he refers to the superiority of handwriting as opposed to typing (in terms of the connection to letters and symbols that are being produced). *Superiority* might be the wrong word to represent his position, but he clearly stated a preference and pointed out the (also IMO undervalued) importance of the written word in thinking through words.

I found myself to be having extremely mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it is a revelation as I have never considered it in this way. Writing by hand certainly feels multidimensional in its expressive capacity compared to tapping on a keyboard; but on the other hand, his dismissiveness about the potential of the digital line (i.e. typing) was slightly heartbreaking.

As someone who has grown up in the digital world (and as someone who equally shares a profound love for the written word), I identify a certain poetry, rhythm and fluidity in typing that is very different from the experience of writing. It has its own dynamics according to which words are crafted: distinguishable patterns are produced using the QWERTY layout; similarly, there exist dedicated hand movements to format text, for punctuation, etc.; and the sounds that emerge from the keys tell me things about the flow of my text. There is a real craft to the digital line too.

This feels like a matter of habit. In my experience, typing is an entirely separate world from handwriting, one that also has latent expressional dimensionality to it, if only one is open and curious to explore its possibilities. However, I recognise the value of mastering both skills, and expect one to find something uniquely awesome in each.
