### 270120: The stars down to Earth

'Adorno was onto something,' I realised, as my shadow wandered through the peculiar scene resembling a familiar tale; perhaps, from the stories of *One Thousand and One Nights*: a vast desertscape exposed by starlight. Whilst my body lay static on the dune, I was left to navigate the restless labyrinth of my mind.

The view was utterly hypnotising, and I began to draw imaginary connections between each glaring ball of gas in the sky, the light emitting a narrative for the rest of the universe to read: complex histories interwoven; the past and the present compressed into a 2D tapestry, broadcast as a nebulous glow, a heap of meaningless noise.

'I have no knowledge of astronomy,' I murmured to myself, but noticed in the periphery of my eye an uncanny constellation emerging.

I awoke to a sensation of sand dripping down my face; and discovered myself half asleep before a computer screen. A glance outside, through the lonely studio window, was telling of night-time: few apartments displayed any evidence of life in the block facing mine. I prepared myself some coffee, and thereafter devoted my full attention to the task at hand: swiftly, I was swallowed into bit space, and my consciousness descended into a dense philosophical fog.

'Epoch 10,000,' proclaimed the terminal, and so, my algorithmic score had been iterated over and played to its end; and yet another ideology had taken material form. Superficially speaking, the results were impressive, but I was unable to articulate the magic bubbling beneath the surface. I imagined life inside my crystal ball, a somewhat absurd personification of computation: a fantasia of microscopic cogwheels and alien lifeforms tearing down my input images into individual pixels, rearranging these into strings and mechanically transforming the sequences into increasingly intelligible sets of features, the laborious process of prediction overseen by an executive jury. The vision humoured me.

Indeed, the operational aspects of my network were concealed, obfuscated by intricate mathematical operations; therefore, making its internal workings unexplainable. Although I wanted to avoid speculating on its wider implications, the idea of deploying abstract authority into a real-world context felt rather worrying. The performance was otherwordly but indecipherable without a map of some kind: to represent the hierarchy, to read my stars.

I felt the full weight of my insomnia, accentuated by caffeine. It was hard to believe that a fragment of my reality could be captured by the system and, literally, broken into bits. The first observable patterns from my experiments evoked a paralysing sense of awe, a childlike wonder, that I continued to experience long into the gentle winter dawn.
