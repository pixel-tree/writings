### 040220: Does a vision materialise when dreamed?

'You’re taking away the poetry from my world, man,' I thought, as I listened intently to the passionate gentleman standing before me.

I drew to pass the time (and to distract myself from thinking about you): an abstract city of information; populated by two androgynous figures overlooking the monotonous plane. 'Look around,' they say. 'The patterns are vague here.' And true they were. The horizon was clouded by a vast sea of noise.

All beings and things around me faded, and I sunk deep into my chair held gently against the hard plastic not only by the ever-penetrating force of gravity but also an ineffable energy: I lost myself to thought, losing track of the day, of position, and of all earthly concepts; a fluffy cloud of nothingness surrounded me as I lost all phenomenal presence. I was stripped down and smitten by my memories. WHACK.

The scene played out within the confines of my mind. I was transported some nights back: holding your gaze, somewhat shy, evoking an atmosphere of tension tender but wild. THUMP. Forces collided in time and space; a profoundly unexpected moment and unanticipated feeling, like an ephemeral poem recited by the universe, emerging momentarily amidst the chaos for us to share. ‘Yada yada…’ my lips were moving to a well-rehearsed story, but my attention was fixed in your stare.

The sonata goes on. The jazz keeps on playing. The moon, perpetually fixed at its piercing exposure, smiling. Does a vision materialise when dreamed?
