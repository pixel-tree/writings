### 060520: Dance dance dance

BAM. Something woke me up in the early hours of the morning. I could see no light shine through the curtains, and I was generally incapable of forming any serious deductions regarding time having been summoned prematurely from a deep sleep.

I sat up on the edge of my futon bed. The floor beneath my feet felt solid and from what first seemed like an innocent pinch of chill on my toes emerged an overwhelming wave of cold that traversed vertically up my body faster than I was able to react. Seeing as there was such significant latency between my sense organs and motor functions at this time, there was little point in resisting the unpleasantness that the bare stone tiles had imposed on my feet. I walked over to the kitchen and brewed some coffee.

My morning rituals werenâ€™t true rituals. Sure, there was a framework within which everything occurred: coffee, radio, reading and perhaps a little bit of writing. However, these events lacked consistency in how they were ordered and I often lost myself to any of these activities for lengthy periods of time. In general my mornings consisted of hanging out in little clothing, enjoying some calm before the expected storm. Indeed, the absence of noise was the most distinct pleasure about this time of day, whereas noon was unreasonably costly for my attention span.

The first notable thing to occupy my mind was a gentle downpour of rain that brushed the ceiling outside, the sound of which was arhythmic but soft and pleasant and something that I was lost to, listening, for a good while. The performance was accompanied by a sound of coffee dripping into the glass pan. My nose caught onto a familiar scent that filled the room. This made my experience less esoteric and more mundane; and it grounded me back to the present, to the realisation that it was yet another Monday, meaning that yet another week had been buried in time and yet another had begun. And I was still standing in my kitchen, yet again contemplating this cycle.

I observed nothing of interest in the garden. The absence of life was a tad strange for this time of year but, then again, it was probably nighttime. I was running on autopilot and time in my equation mattered little, as I would be unable to return to sleep regardless. In this world, time had become an insignificant asset anyway. I had forgotten exactly how long it was since the transition from the past world had taken place, but my intuition was that things had radically changed within a short period of time. Thereafter, my experience of time had transformed from something I had little to spare to something much more elastic and expendable.

It was then that I noticed a full moon in the sky, existing in captivating stillness with few stars distributed across the dark cloudscape. Unperturbed, I poured myself the coffee and played music. Thoughtfully choosing something that fit my state of mind, I danced like a madman. Time passed. I felt no exhaustion and kept in motion. And so I danced on my (in)deterministic dream.
